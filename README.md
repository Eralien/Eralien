### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a perception engineer on self driving. My work on focused on real-time dynamic and static scene understanding. My skill set is full-stack self driving perception, from data to training, from inference to metrics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on scene topology understanding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning large perception multi-modal geometric pretraining.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything towards AGI, especially for geometric understanding and end-to-end perception-planning-control.
